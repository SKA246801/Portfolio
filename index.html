            <p id="bio">
                I learned web development in a coding bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin. I am now a part of the ever-growing community of Full Stack Engineers.
                Going through the bootcamp has shown me just how adaptable you need to be in this industry as technology is always evolving.
                I am constantly teaching myself new things, expanding my knowledge and skillbase in all things programming related.
                I am eager to see the things that I can achieve in my programming career.
